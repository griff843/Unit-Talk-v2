## Merge order

Standalone. No dependency on any other currently-open lane.

## The one production-consequential item

This lane does not flip `best-bets`/`trader-insights` from their current `enabled: true` default in `packages/contracts/src/promotion.ts` — see `verification.md`'s routing note and `DELIVERY_KILL_SWITCH.md` §5. That flip is deliberately left for a follow-up gated on explicit PM sign-off at merge time, not bundled into this PR's default state.

## Migrations applied to production (PM-approved)

- `20260714120000_add_delivery_kill_switch.sql` was applied directly to the live Supabase project (`zfzdnfwdarxucxtaojxm`) with PM sign-off, after a genuine live-DB proof test revealed it had only ever run against a temporary, since-deleted dev branch.
- `20260714130000_bootstrap_delivery_kill_switch_posture.sql` fixes a real gap that migration left: the table started empty, and the fail-closed application default (missing row = killed) would have silently disabled all governed delivery on deploy. This migration seeds current posture from `defaultTargetRegistry` — landed through this same PR-governed path, not a manual write. See `verification.md`'s "PM review round 3" section.
